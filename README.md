# simplySass

## Just a Sass library still in its infancy.

Version 0.2.7 (Alpha)
While it does work, this is still considered in Alpha and things will break. This will be due to changing names and moving functions around where it makes more sense.

simplySass is a Sass library focused on mobile-first design, which helps quickly write clean CSS code. 
As of now, it's able to make use of CSS grid, and some color functions of Sass. In the future it will 
incorporate more features like the use of the popular flexbox and more. Since this is a new project it
will have some breaking changes in the future, but feel free to use it and try it out as it grows.
