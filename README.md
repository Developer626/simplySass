# simplySass

## Just a Sass library still in its infancy.

Version 0.2.7 (Alpha)
While it does work, this is still considered in Alpha and things will break. This will be due to the changing of names and moving around of functions until it makes better sense.

simplySass is a Sass library focused on mobile-first design, which helps quickly write clean CSS code. 
As of now, it's able to make use of CSS grid, and some color functions of Sass. In the future it will 
incorporate more features like the use of the popular flexbox and more. Since this is a new project it
will have some breaking changes in the future, but feel free to use it and try it out as it grows.

*** Warning *** The Documentation is not currently up to date. Most of it should still work, but there are extra features that are not explained yet.
