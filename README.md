# SimplySass

## Just a Sass library still in its infancy.

Version 0.1.0

SimplySass is a mobile first design Sass library meant to make writing clean CSS code quickly and easily. 
As of now, it's able to make use of CSS grid and some color functions of Sass. In the future it will 
incorporate more features like the use of the popular flexbox and more. Since this is a new project it
will have some breaking changes in the future, but feel free to use it and try it out as it grows.
